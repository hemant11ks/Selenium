Page Object Model Design Pattern :

1. Web Pages
2. Page Objects (Variables & Methods)
3. Test Scripts

Note: Variables & Methods are stored separate from Test Scripts.

Benefit of Page Object Model:

1. Code Reusability
2. Code Readability
3. Code Maintainability

Web Pages :       HOME Page               HELP Page
                     |                        |
Page Objects :    HomePage                 HelpPage
              (Variables & Methods)     (Variables & Methods)

Test Scripts : Now TS 1, TS 2 can have access to Page Object of HomePage & HelpPage simultaneously

Note : TS can call the PO but PO will not make a call to  TS.
       Also HomePage wil not make call between HelpPage also TS.
In addition - Base Page & Page Object will be in main directory meanwhile Test script will be placed in Test directory.

Points Need to take Care:

1. If you have WebDriver APIs in your test methods, You are doing wrong (By Simon Stewart)
2. I prefer to include assertions in my Test Scripts and not the BasePage or Page Object class.
3. We verify our Test Scripts and we do not verify the Page Object class.
